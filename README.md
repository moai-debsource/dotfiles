# Personal hyprland dotfiles for development on linux.
Note: there is no fetch config folders, due to

> [!WARNING]  
> **These are work-in-progress dotfiles**: expect bugs/unfinished things, and these dotfiles are updated regularly, meaning they change frequently.
> 
> The reason there is no fetch, is because i use my own fetch program written in python; for more information on it, go to my [other github repo](https://github.com/moai-debsource/lufetch), if you arent using lufetch, remove its usage in .zshrc

Note: make sure you have a .config folder in youre home directory; if youre on a trackpad, change the sensitvity in the hyprland config file to 0.
